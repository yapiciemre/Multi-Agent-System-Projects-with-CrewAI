# Multi-Agent System Projects with CrewAI

This repository contains a series of projects that explore the creation and management of multi-agent systems using the CrewAI framework. Each project demonstrates the use of AI agents to automate tasks and processes across different domains. The projects are structured as Jupyter notebooks, guiding you through the setup, development, and execution of multi-agent systems.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Multi-Agent System and CrewAI with Groq
- **Description**: 
  This project showcases how to build a multi-agent system where agents are assigned specific roles such as Planner, Writer, and Editor. Tasks are distributed among these agents to simulate collaborative work. The project demonstrates the setup of agents, task creation, and the final execution of tasks, with results displayed in markdown format.

### 2. Multi-Agent Customer Support Automation
- **Description**: 
  Focused on automating customer support processes, this project involves creating agents that can role-play and cooperate to efficiently manage customer queries. Agents can delegate tasks to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. The project also integrates memory management and guardrails to maintain context and ensure safe operation.

### 3. Tools for a Customer Outreach Campaign
- **Description**: 
  This project involves the creation of tools and agents to manage a customer outreach campaign. It includes both custom-built tools like SentimentAnalysisTool and CrewAI's built-in tools. Agents are tasked with profiling leads and conducting personalized outreach, leveraging the tools to complete their tasks. The project demonstrates how to integrate and use these tools within the CrewAI framework.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. Each notebook begins with the installation and importation of required libraries, followed by the setup and execution of the multi-agent system.
